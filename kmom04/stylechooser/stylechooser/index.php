<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This example shows how a user can select their own stylesheet. A form is used where the user can select the style of their choice. The form posts to a processing page which updates the session value for the selected style. The processing page then redirects to the form which now shows the selected style and the selected stylesheet is included in the html page head. The config file contains a list of all available styles and maps the selected style to the actual stylesheet.</p>
