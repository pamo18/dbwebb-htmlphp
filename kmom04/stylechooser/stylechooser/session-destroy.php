<h1>Destroying the session</h1>

<?php sessionDestroy(); ?>

<p>The session is now destroyed by calling a function that hosts the code that actually destroys the session, its content and its cookie.</p>

<p>This page should really do a redirect, to actually show that the session is destroyed and no style is choosen, but for now you need to do a reload to actually see the results from the destroyed session.</p>
